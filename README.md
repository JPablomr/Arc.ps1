# Arc.ps1

## What is it?
Arc.ps1 is an asynchronous webserver based on .net's HttpListener and written in Powershell.

## Why?
Why not? It's a good exercise in learning Powershell's capabilities, how it can interact with .Net and learning about Web Servers.

## How to run?
Just run Setup.ps1. Change variables in Variables.ps1 to better suit your needs.

## To Do

- Make a better readme.
- Add more handlers.
- Think about Security. Maybe HTTPS in the future.
- Any other stuff that pops into my head.
